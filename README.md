# Website Care Clinic ZMDH
This project is a Asp.net Core website with a full working live chat system that was made with SingalR.
It was created to help a growing care clinic to talk privately with their clients.
It's also possible for clients to get put in a self-care group and be able to talk with other clients who share the same symptoms.
The website was developed with accessibility in mind.
